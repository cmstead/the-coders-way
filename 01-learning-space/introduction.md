Coders are members of a unique sort of worker, they are knowledge workers. Knowledge workers are people who think for a living. The production of source code is a by-product of thinking about and solving a problem. A variety of different knowledge professions exist, including information tech, security, software development, law, and medicine. These professions all require practitioners to apply what they know to real world problems.

Knowledge is not static. To succeed as a knowledge worker, you must dedicate time and energy to learning. Learning is fundamental to the work coders do. In a coding environment, solving problems and learning are indistinguishable. Solving problems as a coder demands we learn about the business we are solving problems for. Changes in technology drive coders to learn daily. Coders, by their very nature, are learners.

Since coding is knowledge work, coders must be able to learn effectively. The foundation of learning must be set in the physical world. It's not enough to have technical skills, applying your craft by pounding away on the keyboard. The physical space you inhabit will affect the way in which you learn and grow in your career. We are going to explore cognitive load, liminal space, and how to apply the concept of containers to design a space that suits your learning needs.

What is liminal space?

Liminal space, when discussing learning, is the limit of a person's current knowledge. Anything someone doesn't know, but is related to the topic at hand is extra-liminal. Anything someone knows well is sub-liminal. When considering a liminal space within the scope of learning, it is that place where the sub-liminal and extra-liminal knowledge meet. It's a knowledge boundary.

Understanding what liminal space means is critical to understanding how each person will learn best. If someone is working within the space containing only knowledge they already have, they are not learning and may become bored. If someone is trying to tackle a topic they have no foundation for, the may experience overwhelm and fail to learn. Understanding your personal limit of knowledge, you can be more effective in building new knowledge.

What is cognitive load?

Cognitive load, when considering learning, is how much of your brain is dedicated to the work of learning. There are three types of load, extraneous load, intrinsic load, and germane load. Extraneous load is the mental work dedicated to things which are unrelated to the task at hand. Intrinsic load is the load dedicated to meta-work. It's work related to taking in new information. Germane load is the load dedicated to actual learning. Our goal, as we design a learning space, is to reduce extraneous load and simplify intrinsic load. We want to set the stage to maximize our mental effort dedicated to the germane load of the problem at hand.

The sort of thing that can add extraneous load to our workday is distraction. There are numerous distractions around us. As we dig into designing our space, we will focus on eliminating unnecessary distraction. Common distractions are things like ambient noise, work-unrelated items, and unmet needs. By reducing these distractions we can center ourselves on work-learning outcomes.

Once we have reduced or eliminated distractions in our space, we can begin addressing intrinsic load. Intrinsic load can come in the form or cluttered thoughts or extra-liminal learning. There are practices we can use to simplify the process of learning, reducing intrinsic load. It will be useful to include things like timers, notebooks, and reference material.

What are containers?

Containers are physical, sensory, or mental boundaries. Containers are important to define what belongs in or outside of a space. This means containers can be things like walls, floor space, a quiet area, or an area where certain items are not allowed. One of the primary techniques we will explore is using containers to reduce extraneous cognitive load. Defining containers around your learning space enhances your ability to control your environment.

By understanding containers, how they impact cognitive load, and how learning within a liminal space, we can craft a learning environment that suits you personally. We will explore other topics including capturing distractions and retrospecting on your process. These topics and more are all dependent upon having a good foundation of a healthy learning space.
